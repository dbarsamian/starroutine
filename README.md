# StarRoutine
### A habit-creating, goal-tracking app for iOS inspired by the star sticker boards of our childhoods.

## Archived ðŸ“¦
I'm archiving the project as it currently stands. I've decided to archive it because I've come to the conclusion that the project is really just too simple to submit to the App Store. (does it *really* need another "goals" app?) However, I don't think this project is completely useless. I'm proud of the work I did in this app, so instead of scrapping it completely, I'm going to leave it up to use as a resource. Feel free to pick it apart, critique it, improve it, make it your own. 

A few things that I implemented that I'm proud of, that you may want to look at:
- Core Data integration with SwiftUI
- Animated backgrounds in a goal's timeline view
- Human Interface Guidelines-compliant design
